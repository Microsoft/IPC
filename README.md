# IPC

IPC is a C++ library that provides inter-process communication using shared memory on Windows.
A .NET wrapper is available which allows interaction with C++ as well.

# Build

The library is developed and maintained with [Visual Studio 2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853.aspx).
To get started, open the [IPC.sln](https://github.com/Microsoft/IPC.Core/blob/master/IPC.sln) file and build the solution.
The [Boost package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/boost/) will automatically start downloading during the first build.
